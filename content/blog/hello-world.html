<p>
Welcome to <a href="/">FOSS@KIIT</a>. This website and blog is the home
of the FOSS@KIIT society.
</p>
<p>
Our community originated as a result of collaboration between the
students and alumni of KIIT University in January 2018. We focus on free
and open source software (FOSS), open standards, open technologies, and
open content. Our goal is to promote awareness, usage, and development
of FOSS in KIIT University.
</p>
<p>
We believe that it is important for students and professionals to be
involved in FOSS. One could be involved with FOSS as a user of free and
open source software who spreads awareness about the benefits of such
software and technology, or as a developer, tester, or documentation
writer who contributes to further development of such software and
technology.
<p>
</p>
Free and open source software promotes the idea that computer users
should be free to use computer programs without any restrictions, study
their source code, redistribute them, and modify them. It creates a
culture of cooperation and collaboration between software developers as
well as users. Knowledge, in the form of source code, documentation,
improvements to software, etc., flows freely between participants.
</p>
<p>
We hope that we can bring some of this open culture to KIIT via this
society where the students and alumni of the university who love to
build or improve things can come together and collaborate on interesting
ideas and projects.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to be a part of this, just browse around this brand
new website, and if you like the idea, be a part of our community and
