<h2 id="what">What is FOSS?</h2>
<p>
    FOSS stands for free and open source software. It is the union of
    two philosophies: <a
    href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free software
    movement</a> and <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">open source
    initiative</a>. The two philosophies have subtle differences in
    their goals but are mostly similar in their essence. They both
    promote the idea that computer users should be free to use computer
    programs without any restrictions, study their source code,
    redistribute them, and modify them.
</p>
<p>
    This philosophy promotes a culture of cooperation between software
    developers as well as users. Knowledge, in the form of source code,
    documentation, and improvements to software flows freely between
    computer users.
</p>

<h2 id="why">Why FOSS?</h2>
<p>
    Free and open source software is becoming increasingly important in
    the technology industry. Open source tools drive innovation in the
    industry today. In fact, the Internet, the leading compilers,
    databases, security protocols, etc. are all based on open source
    technologies and open collaboration.
</p>
<p>
    Given the extensive use of open source technologies in the industry,
    students and professionals skilled in open source are high in
    demand.
</p>
<p>
    One of the best things about being involved in open source is that
    your work does not stay locked in a particular organization. As you
    move from one organization to another, your work remains with the
    open source community and you. Since your work is released under an
    open source license, the legal framework around the license ensures
    that your work is always accessible to you and others who may
    benefit from your work. The fact that potential users,
    collaborators, and employers can reach your work easily and
    unencumbered earns you street cred in the technology community.
</p>
